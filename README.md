# Growth Mindset project (Lab 01b)

Hello, my name is Angelos Kounavis. I came from Greece about 10 years ago and before codefellows I used to work in marketing. I can't wait to be a part of this software development team.


I am excited to learn more about Growth Mindset and write a few words regarding the topic.

To me, a growth mindset is all about learning and evolving. Some people believe that certain individuals succeed in life because they are talented in a certain area (math, sports, politics, coding). The concept of a "growth mindset" dismantles this belief. Sure, you can be gifted in math, but only through hard work and perseverance you can develop your skills and become better; no matter the level you are at currently.
 
#### Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:

* Always put the effort **(Without effort you can't expect results)**
* Don't be afraid of criticism **(only through feedback you will learn)**
* Don't let obstacles intimidate you **(persistence beats resistance)**

### Fun Fact:
* Below it's me in California one week ago, time passes quickly!!
