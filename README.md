## Growth Mindset project (Lab 01b)

Hello, my name is Angelos Kounavis. I came from Greece about 10 years ago and before codefellows I used to work in marketing. I can't wait to be a part of this software development team.

## Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset

* Always put the effort **(Without effort you can't expect results)**
* Don't be afraid of criticism **(only through feedback you will learn)**
* Don't let obstacles intimidate you **(persistence beats resistance)**
