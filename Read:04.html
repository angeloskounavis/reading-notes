            <p>Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information
                hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or
                client wants the user to process information on a site.</p>

                        <h2> Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                                opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to
                                take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins..</li>
                            <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                                slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where
                                the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors
                                and can lead to strange results.</li>
                            <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                            <li> The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
                        </ol>
