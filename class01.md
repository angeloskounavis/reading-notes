# Class 01

## Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

 *HTTP distributes and collaborates with  hypermedia information systems.It basically     allows users to communicate data on the Web. HTTP let’s  users interact with web resources such as HTML files by transferring  hypertext messages between clients and servers.*

## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

*In class 102 we started by learning about html and after we had a basic idea of the structure we started to link html with css and javascript. You see first you have to create the html content and then the browser will pass through it and then it will recognize the links or scripts that are present (javascript, css etc.). The browser will then generate an in memory DOM tree and then analyze and execute the code. That’s what gives us the visual presentation at the end.*

## How can you find images to add to a Website?

*You could use google images, but make sure you give credit to the source in a footer area so you don’t violate copyrights or use the google license feature. You can add an image by clicking on it and then saving it to your documents.*

## How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

*A string is surrounded by single quotes. The way you create it is by declaring a variable. For example, let userName = ‘John’;
On the other hand, numbers don’t need quotes. For example,
Let x = 5 +2*

## What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

*Variables are used in order to store/save information. There are different ways to create a variable you can write var, let, constant, but for now we are mostly focusing on let from what I’ve seen.*

## What is an HTML attribute?

*Html attributes have extra information about the element we have created without letting that information be visible in the end result. This is just for us to make our work easier to read.*

## Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

*The anatomy of an element consists of an opening tag, the content that goes into that tag and then the closing tag to inform us that this is the end. Example, <> + h1 This is a Header (The reason why I don't enclose it it's because it will translate the code and I don't want that).*

## What is the Difference between article and section element tags?

*article is a single blog post that makes sense by itself without the rest of the information in the page. section  are used to group together content on the page. You can have articles with sections and that way you can edit them and vice versa.*

## What Elements does a “typical” website include?

*How many elements we add to our html is up to us really. But some of the common ones are main, body, section, header, nav, etc.*

## How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

*Well metadata makes it easier for your content to be searched by people and it helps the search engine better understand your content. It can contain the page's title or link to CSS.*

## How is the meta HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

 *The tag defines metadata of an HTML document.  You can find meta tags  inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords etc.*

## How to start to design a Website.

## What is the first step to designing a Website?

*The first step is to have an outline for your website. You might possess the technical skills but if you don’t have the vision of what the end goal is and how to deliver it step by step you will fail.*

## What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

*What I want to accomplish with my website
How will my website help me accomplish my goals
What do I need to to in order to accomplish my goals.*
