I am excited to learn more about Growth Mindset and write a few words regarding the topic.

To me, a growth mindset is all about learning and evolving. Some people believe that certain individuals succeed in life because they are talented in a certain area (math, sports, politics, coding). The concept of a "growth mindset" dismantles this belief. Sure, you can be gifted in math, but only through hard work and perseverance you can develop your skills and become better; no matter the level you are at currently.
