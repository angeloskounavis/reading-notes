# Control flow

*The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.*

## For Example

if (isEmpty(field)) {
  promptUser();
} else {
  submitForm();
}

## JavaScript Functions

*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).*

## JavaScript Function Syntax

*If an expression evaluates to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression. For example:*

## Function Invocation

*The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
* Automatically (self invoked)
