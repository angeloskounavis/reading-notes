## Expressions and operators

*WAt a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.*
The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.*

## Assigning to properties

*If an expression evaluates to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression. For example:*

## Destructuring

*For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.*
