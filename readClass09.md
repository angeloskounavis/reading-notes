## HTML

### Why are forms so important in web development?

* Web forms are main source of interaction between the user and a website. These type of forms let the user enter information that's going to be stored. Example, name, date of birth, email etc.

### When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

* The purpose of our form at this point is to collect the right information. If we don't ask the correct questions we will never receive the correct answers. So I would say a key thing is to make sure you take the time and ask the right questions.

### List 5 form elements and explain their importance

* Opening and closing tag Form: it defines the HTML form for user input
* Opening and closing tag input: defines the input control
* Opening and closing tag textarea: defines a multiline input control
* Opening and closing tag label: defines a label for an input element

## JS

### How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

* Events is the reaction to the users input from my code. For example if I have a prompt message that's asking for you phone number. After you type your phone number I would like to store the data and send a thank you message.

### When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

* The first would be the type of the event (example: " click "  or any other HTML DOM Event.) The second is the function we want to call when the event occurs. Of course that's up to us.

### Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

* It is useful because it can provide extra features and information to our code.

### What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

* According to Stack Overflow "With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements."
