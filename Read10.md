### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

* A syntax error is an error of characters that is meant to be written in a specific programming language. A logical error is an error in a program that causes it to operate the wrong way, but is doesn't terminate abnormally.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

* Well some times when I try to type faster I forget the equal sign and that causes a syntax error. The fix for this is just to add the equal sign. Another mistake I made was to create a correct addition between two numbers when the problem was asking for multiplication.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

* Figuring out your mistakes and correcting them is a big part of a coders career. It's not about just writing code, but also learning how to debug.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

* Debugger is simply put a software tool. It is used to to identify coding errors and inform you of your mistakes.

### Define what a breakpoint is

* You can set a breakpoint with your debugger so your code stops executing and let you examine the values.

### What is the call stack?

* "A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function." (link down below).
