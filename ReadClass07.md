## Explain why we need domain modeling

 * One of the biggest problems that businesses face is when they are trying to communicate between their tech team and their business team. One way to make things easier to read and build that communication is by using the domain modeling. The domain modeling is used to enhance the understanding of a specific problem.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

* Tables should not be used to layout our websites. Manipulating the design of a website in terms of the pictures, where the title is going to be? how will it look like? That's  the job of html and css not for the tables.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >

* The opening and closing table tag: which encloses the entirety of the table

* We use the opening and closing td tag: to create a table cell

* We use the tr opening and closing tag: to stop the first row from growing and start subsequent cells on a second row.

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

* According to Constructors in Java "A constructor in JavaScript is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes." (link below).

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

* With objects you have to "create an empty object, initialize it, and return it." A constructor "will create a new object bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code run the code in the constructor return the new object."

## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

* At my previous job (sales Rep at a Dealership) every sales person was responsible for every step of the sales process (even financing) the customer will follow. The sales person is used to make the sale, walk the customer through the experience of buying a car and add all the documents at the end to connect the finance department with the dmv etc. This way all the departments inherit the information that I gathered from the customer in the beginning.

* "Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object." (link below).
