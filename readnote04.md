## Remote Repositories 

*In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. 
You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.*

### Seeing Your Remotes

* By using git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin.”
* By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.*
