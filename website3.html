            <h2>Greece</h2>

            <p>Greece is one of the most beautiful destinations one can visit. Some of the reasons for that is due to
                the warm and crystal clear waters of the mediterranean sea. Along the coast of Greece you will find
                plenty of beach bars, cafe shops and restaurants (all for cheap!!).</p>
            <p>If you are a fun of history then you will have 2,000 years of ancient Greek history to explore. And if by
                any chance you are a foodie. Well, let's not forget about the <b>Greek salad</b>, <b>Gyro</b> and
                <b>Mousaka</b>(among other delicious dishes).
