### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s

* The first types of videos we had were in the format of flash and silver light which came with a lot of embedded issues. Later on we were able to include videos in html which improved compatibility and it would include audio elements.


### Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element

* When we use src and control attributes it specifies that video controls should be displayed.

### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?

* According to the article Video and Audio Content "The paragraph inside the video tags
This is called fallback content â€” this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the video element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers." (link below).

### Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters

* The video is a nice attachment which in many case can help people understand the content of your website. The audio however, I haven't seen much, but it would work in a case of an audio book example in your page. Let's say you would like to start selling audio books online. Maybe that could be a way to showcase your work.

### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

* According to the article Relationship of grid layout to other layout methods. "Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time." (Link Below).

### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences

* Grid container: "you have to set the display property to grid or inline-grid . Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows."

* Grid item: "The grid-column CSS shorthand property specifies a grid item's size and location within a grid column by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement."

* Grid line: "Grid lines are created when you define tracks in the explicit grid using CSS Grid Layout." (All Links Below).


### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

* By using responsive images we help deliver having the best file size, "the right image for the right screen size". And that will improve the user experience and it will also improve our loading time.

### Define the following img attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used

* The srcset attribute points to the images URLs. And sizes specifies the image size and browser conditions. According to the HTML Attributes article "The srcset specifies 3 images of different size: small, medium, large. The specified sizes are 120, 193, and 278 pixels respectively. The 'w' unit indicates width (in pixels)."

### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

* The srcset it simply provides more options. it allows you to define a list of different image resources ex. "size information so that you can pick the most appropriate image based on the actual device's resolution.'
