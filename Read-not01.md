# A Small Summary of Markdown and GitHub

* Markdown is an easy text formating syntax and the goal here is to make the process of writting text easier to the people that needed. Oh btw, even Facebook is using Markdown for their websites. So it's not just for rookies!

## For Example:

*If you want to create a level 1 Heading then, the only thing you will need to type is (#) and then add the text you want next to it.*

*If you would like to create a paragraph then use blank lines to separate your text*

*You would like to create a bold text? No problem, just use two asterisks*

## Now why use Github?

* Well GitHub allows you to create a repository name. Add some help from Jekyll to the mix and the result would be a profesional looking website.
* GitHub basically translates text into a website that you can share with friends or you can use for your own business!!
