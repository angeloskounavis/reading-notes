# Read: 06 - JavaScript - basic output

## Input Output

*The very first thing we need to learn is how to interact with the JavaScript code running in the browse. There are a number of way JavaScript can display text for the user (output). The most simple one is by using the alert function.*

### alert

*This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text. (You can click on Try! that will open the specific script in a separate window.) The alert() function is actually rarely used, but it is an easy way to show the use of JavaScript.*

## Prompt

*The fist one is called prompt. It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in.*
