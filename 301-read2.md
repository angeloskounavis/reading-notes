## Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?


## What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

### "involves all the declarations, definitions, and initialization of properties, default props as well as the initial state of the component required by the developer."

## Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates


## What does componentDidMount do?

### "allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM ".

## What types of things can you pass in the props?

### You can pass objects, arrays and functions


## What is the big difference between props and state?

### State is handled in the component and you can updated inside the component. Props are handled outside the component and is handled outside as well. When you change the state inside your apllication it will rerender that section but with props you have to render it outside.


## When do we re-render our application?

### "React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props."

## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

### "Data that we want to store it could be a string a number of any complex object". If handling a component inside the component then you need to use state.
