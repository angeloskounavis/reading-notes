# Read Notes Class 03

## HTML

### When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

* We mostly use the unordered list to group items that the order they are in is not as important. It comes in the form of a bulleted list.

### How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

* According to the unordered list element article “you can change the default bullet style for an unordered list with the type attribute”. There are three ways you can change it by typing circle, disc, square.

### When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

* Use the ordered list in places that the order of the elements is important. For example, which marathon athlete came first, second, third. While an unordered list is better to use in elements that the order is not important such as a grocery shopping list.

### Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

* You can use the enclosed li tag or use a lowercase attribute that’s inclosed in "quotes"

## CSS

### Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

* In the example of a box model a margin extends the edge element's border to pretty much create more space. while padding is the space inside the element's border. It basically extends the content area.

### List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model

* Content: what is visible to the people that clicked on your website
* Margins: the space around your element
* Borders: extends the padding area to include the element's borders
* Padding: the space inside the element to extend content area

## JavaScript

### What data types can you store inside of an Array?

* According to the article array in java, arrays in this situation can store both primitive and nonprimitive types of data. Example, primitive data would be strings, null, object, and numbers. While nonprimitive would be data types is the object (link to source # 3)

### Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

* This array is a valid JavaScript array, and you can access the value stored by giving the array you choose a new value.

### List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do

*According to the article expressions and operators these are the five shorthand operators.*

* X >>> = f ()
* X = f ()
* X += f ()
* X *= f ()
* X -= f ()

### Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why

* I basically took the code and placed it on replit. After that I console.log the last part. That gave me the result of 10. I am not sure however, why I didn’t see the word dog or why it wasn’t added in the response.

### Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program

* A real world example of a conditional statement would be if I would ask you if you would like to watch Game of Thrones today. If the answer is yes, we will watch it. If not, we will not watch it.

### Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript

* A good  example would be our email passwords. If we put it right then we can continue to the page. If not we will have to try again until we get it right.
