# About Files

*Would you like to learn the first and most importnant thing of linux? Well, **everything is a File**. When you write a text that's considered a file even your keyboard is a file. Another thing to note is that linux has extensions.*

## Common extensions of Linux

*file.exe - an executable file or program.*

*file.txt - a plain text file.*

*file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.*

## Quotes

*The important part of using quotes is to remember to close the text within that quote. You can use either single or double quotes.*

*"Hello World"* or *'Hello World'* *(both work just fine in this case)*
