### Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.

* At codefellows we have to work in teams for our 201 final project. We also did some teamwork before that. Understanding what makes a team work and how you can cultivate a safe environment were all the ideas are accepted is vital for the teams productivity.


### If there are no questions provided, summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from your previous work or home experience.

* I can totally relate to this article. Looking through my codefellows experience so far I have done my best work when I was working with at least one more person. Since we are all new to this there are no biases so we are always trying to help one another. The results of our work are also looking much better than if we had done it by ourselves. There are things that I know how to do, that my partner maybe doesn’t and vice versa. Since then I always teamed up with another person for my lab work and so far it has been paying off.


## Things I want to know more about

* I want to know if you are in a team that has an environment that doesn’t allow each other to prosper how do you change that? Do you talk to the manager or try to talk to the team?

* What if the team is not skillful enough to complete a project, but they have an incredible culture inside that team. Then what do you do? Change the team or train them?
